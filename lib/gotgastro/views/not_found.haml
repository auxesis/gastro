        Sorry!
        %small
          We don't quite know what you were looking for.
      %p
        Maybe
        %strong
          %a{:href => link_to('/')}
            start a new search?
      %p
        Think there should be something here?
        - issue = { :title => "Couldn't find content at #{request.path}",
                    :body => "When I went to #{request.path}, I expected to see <SOMETHING>" }
        - query = nav_query(issue)
        - bug_url = 'https://github.com/auxesis/gastro/issues/new?' + query
        %a{:target => '_bug', :href => bug_url}
          Report a bug.
